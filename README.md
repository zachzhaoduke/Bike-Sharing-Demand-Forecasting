# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Forecasting
After data visualizations and simple feature selections. I split the train file into training dataset and testing dataset. Then I conducted linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Decision tree regressor, random forest regressor as well as adaptive boosting regressor to train the model. Meanwhile, I used GridSearchCV to help conduct hyperparameter tuning to improve the performances of models. Afterwards, I evaluated the performance of models based on the RMSE of the testing dataset and chose adaptive boosting model as the final model to predict the user count in test file.
